Project Structure
app.json - Expo project configuration
tsconfig.json  - TypeScript configuration with strict checks
assets - App icons, splash screen, and media assets
src - Source code for app screens, components, and logic
components - Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.)
screens - User-facing screens (Menu, Orders, Profile, etc.)
navigation - Navigation setup (stack/tab navigators)
utils - Helper functions and constants

Configuration Files
app.json
Defines metadata, app icons, splash screens, and platform-specific settings.
Example:
Splash screen background: #ffffff for a clean, minimal entry.
Icons: Adaptive icons ensure branding consistency across devices.
tsconfig.json
Extends Expo’s base TypeScript configuration.
"strict": true → Ensures type safety, reduces bugs, and makes the app more robust.

User-Centered Design Considerations
The app is designed with users at the core:
Accessibility:
Light interface for readability.
Clear splash and icons for easy recognition.
Tablet compatibility ensures inclusivity.
Consistency:
Standard navigation patterns reduce cognitive load.
Platform-native behaviors (Android edge-to-edge, iOS tablets).
Efficiency:
Minimalist UI with clear actions (explore, order, contact).
Performance optimized via Expo and strict TypeScript typing.
Engagement:
Intuitive splash and branding increase trust.
